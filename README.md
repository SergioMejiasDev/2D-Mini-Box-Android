# 2D-Mini-Box
(Android Version)

Collection of 2D minigames completely programmed by me. Here I will be collecting different games that I am doing, inspired by various arcade classics.

The instructions for each game are visible by pressing the "Help" button within the start menu.

I am only the author of the programming. The sprites and the SFX are not my property.

The playable game can be downloaded from https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SergioMejias.MiniBox2D
